# Learning_Xsections
In this repository there is a collection of python scripts to learn the cross section of various models using neural networks. For the moment we specialised on the Inert Doublet Model. 
# The Inert Doublet Model case
Two models were investigated : an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and a RandomForest algorithm. The aim is to predict the 8 cross section of proton proton collision at 13 TeV into:
- H0 H0
- A0 A0
- H+ H-
- A0 H0
- H+ H0
- H+ A0
- A0 H-
- H0 H-

At present, given the data collected in IDM_xsec_13TeV.csv, the best model is the RandomForest algorithm.
